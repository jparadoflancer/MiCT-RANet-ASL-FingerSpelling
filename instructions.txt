Before all else, checkout the `feature/cpu-only` branch

1. Installing Python
Make sure that you have the latest Python 3 version installed and enabled (Python 3.10). Make sure that this is the python version in use when executing the rest of the instructions.

-- Installing Python 3.10
> sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv

-- Creating and activating the virtualenv
Create virtual environment for the project. This can be created anywhere, though for the sake of being neat you can also do it inside the project folder itself
> python -m venv venv # assuming that `python` here refers to python3.10

Activate the virtualenv for your current shell session
> source venv/bin/activate

2. Installing project dependencies
> pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Downloading the model
Download the model from https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C28F3ED40E5299FC!27128&authkey=!AEAW6uCPOQpduVs&e=KY07YI. Select the third file `MiCT-RANet34.pth`

Move this file into the repo's data/ dir.

4. Starting the server
It is recommended to run the server using uwsgi:
> uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:5000 --protocol=http -w webcam:app --enable-threads
